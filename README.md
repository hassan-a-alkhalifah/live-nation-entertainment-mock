# Live Nation Entertainment Mock

#### Angular exercise, 10/19/2018

#### By _Hassan Al-khalifah_

## Description

This webpage is a mock from [Live Nation Entertainment's](http://www.livenationentertainment.com/) website. This is a project that was required from [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/) as a way to showcase my understanding of setting up an Angular environment, using components, directives, modules and more. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.

The webpage is broken into three main components (sections), the header (navigation bar), main content body and the footer. Within these components, the use of directives, i.e. ngFor, ngIf etc., will be used to add dynamic display/functionality to the webpage. At the time of writing this, the information/images display are  hard coded, but eventually, a Firebase (noSQL database) will be used instead of hard coded datasets.

## Setup Instructions

* Open terminal
* Make sure your in the Desktop directory
```
~ $ cd desktop
```
* Clone the repo
```
~/Desktop $ git clone [REPO URL]
```
* Navigate into main directory of cloned REPO
```
~/Desktop $ cd directory-name
```
* Run npm install in terminal to install all required dependencies
```
~/Desktop/directory-name $ npm install
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help
